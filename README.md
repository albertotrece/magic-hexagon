This is the official GitHub page for my game: Magic Hexagon. It's a fun game where the objective is to rotate hexagons - containing 6 triangles each inside a bigger, outer hexagon containing all of the inner hexagons - to make a pattern.

It's slightly inspired by the Rubik's cube, and also by 2048 - not in terms of the gameplay, but in terms of the idea to build a game in just 2 days and then put it on GitHub for people to play and donate to if they really like it. It's much more colourful, however, than 2048 - about the same as a Rubik's cube.
